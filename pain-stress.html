              <h5>Causes:</h5>
              <p>Pain is simply the sensation of tissue damage in the body. First, tissue damage occurs. Individual pain receptors  in the region of the damage called nociceptors are connected to the spinal cord via axons and nerve fibers. When the nociceptors are activated, they send electric signals up an axon or nerve fiber. Each nerve fiber is part of a peripheral nerve composed of other nerve fibers. The electrical signal from the nociceptors goes up the peripheral nerve to reach the tip of the spinal cord. Within the spinal cord, neurotransmitters are released that activate other nerves that pass signals to the brain. Once in the brain, the signals reach the thalamus, which in turn relays the signals to the somatosensory cortex, frontal cortex, and limbic system. The somatosensory cortex enables the sensation of the damage, while the frontal cortex and limbic system enable humans to interpret the pain. </p>
              <br />
              <h5>Effects:</h5>
              <p>Pain can cause both automatic and conscious responses in humans. Automatic responses occur very quickly and without thought, such as pulling your finger away from a sharp needle or yanking back your foot when your toe gets stubbed. In addition to automatic responses, pain can be cognitively appraised and consciously acted on accordingly. Cognitive appraisal is subjective and depending on circumstance, age and other factors. For example, a younger person may have a dramatic response to being stung by a bee involving tears and complaining while an adult may be able to bear the pain without visible reaction. In addition to automatic and conscious responses to pain, emotional responses are often associated with more serious pain and injury, usually sadness, anger or fear in different contexts. Long term pain often results in changes in behavior due to these emotional responses along with the inability to sleep or function as usual.</p>

              <h5>Causes:</h5>
              <p>Stress is the body’s way of responding to a perceived threat or danger. Common causes of stress are problems at work, relationship issues, money troubles, health, and even simpler issues such as having to give a presentation. When these stressors are perceived by the body, the fight-or-flight response is activated, and stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline are released into the bloodstream. This can cause changes in the body such as increased blood pressure, sharper senses, increased breath rate. The fight-or-flight response allows you to stay focused and alert when facing acute (short-term) stress. If chronic (long-term) stressors such as work or relationship issues are present however, the body is in a heightened state of stress for a majority of the time, which can present serious issues. </p>
              <br />
              <h5>Effects:</h5>
              <p>Stress can negatively affect all aspects of your health. Physical health deterioration symptoms include headaches, muscle pain, chest pain, fatigue, and sleep problems. Symptoms of emotional stress include anxiety, restlessness, lack of motivation or focus, irritability or anger, and sadness or depression. Stress can also cause behavioral changes including eating disorders, outburst, addiction, social withdrawal and less exercising. Your hypothalamus triggers the release of adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones cause an increase in heart rate to supply blood to the muscles and other important organs and an increase in respiration. If the stressor isn’t stopped, chronic stress can result. Because stress responses are used for short term “fight or flight” reactions, the constant pressure of chronic stress on the body can cause pain and tight muscles, type 2 diabetes from an overactive liver, and a weakened immune system.</p>

              <h5>Similarities:</h5>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;">Since stress is defined as a physical and chemical response to discomfort, and pain is defined as an unpleasant, mental sensation in response to tissue damage, it can be hard to find similarities between the two. However, Stress and Pain are both responses to discomfort, and studies have shown they are very connected with one another. According to new findings, prolonged stress can cause chronic pain, “a prolonged physical pain that lasts for longer than the natural healing process should allow” (Babbel). Traumatic events, such as those that lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have been shown to alter the human perception of pain. On the contrary, prolonged emotional issues, such as a mental feeling of pain, has been shown to increase symptoms of stress. Although the responses are physically different, one can not be had without the other. </p>

              <h5>Differences:</h5>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                Pain is an unpleasant sensation and emotional experience linked to tissue damage. Its purpose is to allow the body to react and prevent further tissue damage.
We feel pain when a signal is sent through nerve fibers to the brain for interpretation.
The experience of pain is different for everyone, and there are different ways of feeling and describing pain. Pain can be short-term or long-term, it can stay in one place, or it can spread around the body. Stress is primarily a physical response. When stressed, the body thinks it is under attack and switches to ‘fight or flight’ mode, releasing a complex mix of hormones and chemicals such as adrenaline, cortisol and norepinephrine to prepare the body for physical action. This causes a number of reactions, from blood being diverted to muscles to shutting down unnecessary bodily functions such as digestion.
