              <p>Somatosensory illusions are  illusions caused by perception of a  cutaneous stimuli that is not actually present. One example of a Somatosensory illusion is Aristotle’s illusion. In Aristotle’s illusion, a person crosses their fingers and touches a small object. Although they are only touching one object, they will feel as if they are touching two objects. This happens because the brain is unable to recognize that your fingers are crossed. The small object touches the outside of both fingers at the same time, which causes it to be interpreted as two separate objects. </p>

              <p>Optical illusions are illusions caused by the visual system and characterized by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. There are three types of optical illusions. The first is literal illusions which is when a person perceives an image that is different from the actual object because an outside stimulus warps the image. One example would be a stick seeming bent when submerged in water. The second type is a physiological illusion which is an effect of excessive stimulation of a specific type such as brightness, color, size, position, tilt, or movement. The third type is a cognitive illusion which is the result of unconscious inferences. There are three types of cognitive illusions: Ambiguous (when an image can be perceived two ways), Distorting (things in the image distract you and make things seem warped when they aren’t), and Paradoxical (the image seems to be depicting something impossible).</p>

              <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                Somatosensory illusions are  illusions caused by perception of a  cutaneous stimuli that is not actually present. One example of a Somatosensory illusion is Aristotle’s illusion. In Aristotle’s illusion, a person crosses their fingers and touches a small object. Although they are only touching one object, they will feel as if they are touching two objects.

              <h5><b>Differences</b></h5>
              <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                The most obvious difference between optical illusions and somatosensory illusions is as the name implies: one deals with discrepancies between objective visual stimuli and the brain’s interpretation of them and the other involves confusion of cutaneous stimuli. That being said, optical illusions can be perceived without any physical interaction with the body while somatosensory stimuli can only be interpreted by the body with physical contact. Similarly, somatosensory stimuli are processed in the primary somatosensory cortex while optic illusions are processed in the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobe.

              <h5><b>Optical Experiment Outline</b></h5>
              <p>In order to observe people's responses to various illusions, the following images were shown to various participants: </p>
              <div class="row">
              <img src="img/movement.jpg" class="center"></img>
              <img src="img/shadows.jpg" class="center"></img>
              <img src="img/size.jpg" class="center"></img>
              </div>
              <hr />

              <p>
                The first illusions are designed to make viewers see motion in a static image, the second ones convey a color gradient where there is none through the use of shadows, and the third use perspective to play with our perception of sizes. The participants were shown each of the images and if, based on the participant's responses to several questions, the illusions successfully deceived the participant, the trial was recorded as a "yes" in the table below. Through this process, we hoped to understand what makes some optical illusions particularly deceptive.

              <hr />
              <h5><b>Somatosensory Experiment Outline</b></h5>
              <p>After finishing with the optical illusions, we repeated the process with the following well-known somatosensory illusions: </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Crossed-Finger Discrimination:</b> The participant crosses their fingers and touches a pencil eraser. They may perceive two pencils rather than one</li>
                <li><b>Sinking Arms:</b> The participant holds their hands at a 45 degree angle to the ground while lying down for 30 seconds. They then slowly lower them. Because of the way proprioceptive sense is communicated to the brain, the person will often feel as if their hands are sinking into the ground.</li>
                <li><b>Helium Hands:</b> The participant presses their hands against the inside of a doorway for 30 seconds and then steps away from it: often times, the participant's arms will feel lighter than air and drift upwards.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>We then recored whether or not the illusions achieved the intended effect in the following table:</p>
